<p class=text>
After a successful inaugural season, the Chicago Cyber Basketball League prepares to tip off its second season on Monday. Last year's participants picked new teams, with the team with the worst record receiving the first pick, and last year's champion, former Hornets GM Matt Pepoff getting the last pick. While this system will make it more difficult for last year's top players to remain successful, it's the newcomers who may be battling it out for a title this season. Here's a look at the team draft and what to look for this season from each GM.</p>

</table>

<ol>
<li><p class=text2><b>Kelvin Anderson, Houston Rockets</b> - Word around the league is that newcomer Kel is all talk and no action. But through some crafty trading, Anderson deepened his team and acquired future hall of famer Karl Malone in the process. Also acquired were Greg Ostertag, Bryon Russell, John Starks and Jermaine O'Neal. Out are Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and Cuttino Mobley, who failed to make a decent showing last season. Kel is confident that his new-look Rockets will pack the punch needed to win the Midwest, but thier hopes rest solely on the broad shoulders of Malone and Pippen.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Danny McLeod, Los Angeles Clippers</b> - McLeod, an unknown quantity takes over a young Clippers team, drafted second by talented, but perhaps overconfident former GM Tom Rudy. The Clippers added Derek Anderson and rookie Lamar Odom to their roster in the offseason, but McLeod still may have a hard time achieving the lofty goals set by his predecessor. The revloving door in the Clips head coach's office may continue this season.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Tom Haley, Los Angeles Lakers</b> - Haley wasted no time snatching up LA's other team, the Lakers. Also a newcomer, Haley is a talented player with an equally talented squad. Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice, last year's CCBL MVP, will be the focus of a tough inside-outside game, drawing double-teams which will help Kobe Bryant score easily. The Lakers will be in the thick of things in the Pacific Division which, like last season's Central Division, is loaded with skilled GMs.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Kyle English, Minnesota Timberwolves</b> - One of the youngest GMs in the CCBL, newcomer Kyle "Red" English can relate to his superstar forward Kevin Garnett. Garnett will be the focus of a talented offense which includes Terrell Brandon, Joe Smith, and rookie sharpshooter Wally Szczerbiak. While Red is the constant target of message board attacks, he will retaliate only on the court. This young squad will be in the thick of things in the West.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Patrick Smith, New York Knicks</b> - Another unknown quantity, Smith takes control of last season's Atlantic division champs. Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby inject some much-needed youth into their roster, but the Knicks may still have a hard time repeating last season's effort. Last season, the Knicks faced little competition in the Atlantic except the Celtics. But the Celtics, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, and Washington Wizards, led by former Knicks GM Sean Randolph, will make things tough for the Knicks this season.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Arepa Amarilla, Portland Trailblazers</b> - Arepa didn't hesitate when the deepest team in the league and last season's Western Conference champs were still around at the sixth pick. But Arepa wasn't satisfied with a team of above average players. He needed a superstar... or two. Through some bold trades, Arepa acquired Gary Payton and Hakeem Olajuwon to lead his veteran squad. Rasheed Wallace, Steve Smith, and Detlef Schrempf round out a starting five that will give the opposition fits at every position. Look for the Blazers to come out on top in the West again this season.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>David Blozis, Sacramento Kings</b> - After an uneventful season with the Nets, Blozis takes over a young and talented Kings squad which features Chris Webber and Jason Williams. Vlade Divac, Corliss Williamson, and newly-acquired Nick Anderson complete the starting five. Can Blozis do for the Kings what he failed to do for the Nets? Only time will tell.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Scott Steres, Phoenix Suns</b> - After struggling in a tough Eastern Conference with the Miami Heat last season, Steres takes his game out west. The Suns were one of the top teams in the West last season, but they have since added Penny Hardaway, Rodney Rogers, and rookie Shawn Marion to their squad. Along with Jason Kidd, Tom Gugliotta, and Cliff Robinson, the Suns have the talent to make some noise in the West, but Steres will need to step up his game.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Jason Frank, San Antonio Spurs</b> - Jason "Fishloaf" Frank is another newcomer, known in other leagues as a savvy trader. 'Loaf didn't think twice about sending David Robinson and Avery Johnson packing for Denver to acquire Tim Hardaway and P.J. Brown from Miami in a three-way deal. Tim Duncan will move into the center position where he is capable of dominating. With Tim Hardaway running the point, Duncan should be even more effective than he was last season. Brown will keep the Spurs strong defensively up front and help Duncan out on the boards. The Spurs hope their "Tim squared" tandem can compensate for lack of depth at the SG and SF spots, but chances are Fishloaf isn't done dealing yet. The Spurs should be a serious force in the Midwest.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Mike Aparicio, Toronto Raptors</b> - Midway through a disappointing season with the Washington Wizards, Aparicio left the CCBL to start his own NBA Live league, which failed miserably. Fortunately, he lucked out when the tenth pick in the CCBL draft opened up. Despite the availability of some more talented teams, Aparicio selected the Raptors for one reason: Vince Carter. Last year's Rookie of the Year, Carter will be the focus of the Raptors offense once again. Despite having a talented club, the Raptors finished with the worst record in the league last year under the control of absentee GM Bryan Timmerman. But the addition of sharpshooter Dell Curry and athletic forward Antonio Davis will give Aparicio a shot to redeem both himself and the Raptors for last season's failures.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Dave Fleming, Cleveland Cavaliers</b> - Fleming, who helmed a struggling Orlando Magic team last season, has plenty of talent at his disposal to earn some respect in the East this season. A powerhouse in last season's talented Central Division, the Cavs have added veteran forward Lamond Murray and rookies Andre Miller and Trajan Langdon to their squad. Shawn Kemp will lead the Cavs, and along with a healthy Zydrunas Ilgauskas will form a solid frontcourt. Meanwhile Murray, Miller, and Langdon will battle for playing time with Brevin Knight, Bob Sura, Wesley Person, and Cedric Henderson. A few savvy trades by Fleming could strenghten this team even further. If the Cavs stand pat, they still have the goods to contend for the Central division title.
</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Michael Young, Miami Heat</b> - Last season, Young took over the struggling Washington Wizards in mid-season and narrowly missed the last spot in the playoffs. This season, he gets to start from scratch with one of the most talented squads in the league. Young pulled off an incredible feat by adding Antonio McDyess and Grant Hill to his roster, which already includes Alonzo Mourning. The Heat, without a doubt, now boast the best frontcourt in the league. Nick Van Exel replaces Tim Hardaway at the point and is teamed with Voshon Lenard in the backcourt giving the Heat have a formidable inside-outside game that will win them the East.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Bill Rhu, Boston Celtics</b> - Newcomer Bill Rhu takes over a team rooted deeply in tradition. The Atlantic division runners-up shook things up by shipping Antoine Walker to Houston for Brian Grant and Sam Mack. Rhu further made waves by announcing that Dana Barros and Tony Battie would replace Kenny Anderson and Vitaly Potapenko in the starting linup. While the Celtics lost Ron Mercer in the off season, they acquired rebounding wiz Danny Fortson along with former Celtic Eric Williams, who will both come off the bench. Paul Pierce is now "the man" on this squad, and along with Mack and Barros will let three's rain all night while Battie and Grant do the dirty work inside. In a tough division, the Celtics may be hard-pressed to succeed, but Rhu is more than capable of taking this team to the playoffs.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Daniel Insogna, Utah Jazz</b> - Another newcomer, Daniel Insogna takes over the team which sported the best record in the West last season. Insogna shocked the fans in Utah by trading career Jazz forward Karl Malone to the Rockets along with Bryon Russell and Greg Ostertag in exchange for Charles Barkley and Antoine Walker. The Jazz don't lose much with Barkley at the four spot, and can start the versitile Walker at small forward. With veterans John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek in the backcourt, and Howard Eisley and Shandon Anderson ready to step up, the Jazz could be in contention for a title once again. But in a tougher conference than last season and with an inexperienced GM, the Jazz could struggle early on while Barkley and Walker adjust to their system.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Bryan Timmerman, Indiana Pacers</b> - Timmerman was a constant no-show as GM of the Raptors last year. As a result, his squad finished with the worst record in the league. Somehow, the commissioner found it in his heart to give Timmerman a second chance, and Timmerman has vowed to change his ways. He has a talented squad at his disposal. Last season, the Pacers finished third in the Central division, but also had the third best record in the league, mostly thanks to the hot shooting of Reggie Miller. This season, the Pacers return minus Antonio Davis, who was swapped for Toronto's draft pick, Jonathan Bender. If Timmerman shows up for his games, the Pacers could still be competitive, but that's a big "if".</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Charles Douglas, Milwaukee Bucks</b> - Sam Cassell, Ray Allen, and Glenn Robinson form a steady threesome, but the Bucks still failed to make the playoffs last season. Former Mavs GM Chuck Douglas hopes to change all that this season. The Bucks added vets Danny Manning and Dale Ellis to the fold, and hope it will be enough to put them into the playoffs this season. Look for the Bucks to be a sleeper to win the Central.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Al Arango, New Jersey Nets</b> - The CCBL Commissioner passed up an offer to run the more talented Charlotte Hornets for the chance to turn this struggling team around. Last season, Arango took the talent-starved Denver Nuggets to the playoffs, and the Nets ownership hope he can do the same for the Nets this season. The addition of Stephon Marbury will certainly help their cause. Jayson Williams and Keith Van Horn form a solid front line, and Kerry Kittles and Kendall Gill round out the starting five. If Arango can get production from his bench, the Nets will be in the hunt for a playoff spot this season.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Gavin Routt, Charlotte Hornets</b> - Despite winning the CCBL title last season, the Hornets weren't satisfied. In the offseason, they shook up their roster by sending league MVP Glen Rice to the Lakers in exchange for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell. They also drafted point guard Baron Davis to backup David Wesley and signed free-agent center Brad Miller to deepen their frontcourt. To run their new team, the Hornets signed local Gavin Routt, who is eager to prove that his team still has what it takes to win it all. Routt will have a hard time duplicating last season's 73-9 season, but the Hornets will still be in a good position to win the Central division.</p> 

<li><p class=text2><b>Jimmy Lee Cottrell, Philadelphia 76ers</b> - The offensively-challenged Sixers made few moves in the offseason to improve on last season's disappointing effort. Allen Iverson will again be the main offensive weapon for Cottrell's team. Whereas the Sixers' former GM stressed offense, Cottrell must stress defense if he wants to succeed in a tough Atlantic division. If Iverson's teammates can step up, they have a chance at making the playoffs.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Russ Shumate, Vancouver Grizzlies</b> - Russ Shumate has high expectations for his new team. After shipping first-round pick Steve Francis to the Rockets for Othella Harrington and Michael Dickerson in the offseason, the Grizzlies solidified their starting five, giving their talented young forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim some much needed help. Mike Bibby is developing as a decent point guard, and he is excited to be reunited with his former Arizona teammate, Dickerson. Bryant Reeves has yet to show he's worth the $65 million contract the Grizzlies signed him to a few years ago, but is serviceable in the middle. Shumate is capable of pushing his team hard enough to make the playoffs, but he has his work cut out for him in a deep Western conference.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Clifford Lee, Dallas Mavericks</b> - Last year's CCBL runner-up takes his game to Dallas, where he has already begun to make his presence felt. Lee traded Michael Finley to Atlanta for defensive guru Dikembe Mutombo. Mutombo will team with Shawn Bradley to make the tallest and best shotblocking frontcourt in the league. The Mavs also have Kelvin Cato coming off the bench, who was acquired along with Damon Stoudamire and Bonzi Wells from the Blazers for Dirk Nowitzki, Gary Trent, and Chris Anstey. Without Finley however, Dallas may struggle to get points on the board. Lee needs to make a few more trades in order to make a run at the playoffs.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Harley Williams, Atlanta Hawks</b> - The talented GM of last season's Phoenix team lucked out when the Atlanta Hawks fell to him at the 22nd pick. After a first round playoff loss, the Hawks looked to change from a defensive team to an offensive team. As a result, they traded shooting guard Steve Smith to the Blazers for Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson, and shipped Mookie Blaylock to the Warriors for Bimbo Coles and a draft pick, which they used to acquire point guard Jason Terry. The Hawks also signed free-agent center Lorenzen Wright. But apparently that wasn't enough for Williams, who shipped Mutombo to the Mavs in exchange for Michael Finley and Sean Rooks. Finley and Rider form a high-scoring tandem, with Jim Jackson and LaPhonso Ellis coming in for them off the bench. Wright will move into the center spot and will team with Alan Henderson up front. The Hawks hope all their moves will put them over the hump. Look for this team to go deep into the playoffs.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Sean Randolph, Washington Wizards</b> - After guiding the Knicks to the Atlantic Division title, Sean Randolph sought out a new challenge. The Wizards, if nothing else, were a challege indeed. After a mediocre season under Mike Aparicio, the Wizards were turned around by Mike Young, who brought them just short of the playoffs. Once Young left to coach the Heat, the resurgent Wizards were quick to sign the talented Randolph to run the show in D.C. The Wizards finally aqcuired a servicable center in Ike Austin, giving them a talented starting five with Juwan Howard, Mitch Richmond, Rod Strickland, and Tracy Murray. Unfortunately, their bench was depleted in the off season, and top draft pick Richard Hamilton, MVP of the Final Four, is holding out for a larger contract and will not play this season. Randolph needs his starters to play big minutes. If they can hold up, they are capable of contending for a playoff spot.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Chris Compton, Denver Nuggets</b> - Compton, GM of the Pacific champion Lakers last season, was eying the Denver Nuggets from the very beginning. So when they were still available with the 24th pick, he didn't have to think twice. After a surprising season under GM Al Arango, the Nuggets acquired Ron Mercer from the Celtics, giving them a solid starting five. Upon being hired as GM, Compton dealt Antonio McDyess and Nick Van Exel to the Heat and received veterans David Robinson and Avery Johnson from the Spurs. With this new lineup, Raef LaFrentz can move to the power forward position, and Avery Johnson serves as a more natural point guard. Johnson will be among the league's assist leaders with Mercer, LaFrentz, Robinson, and long-range bomber George McCloud to pass to. Look for the Nuggets to be in the thick of the playoffs again this season.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>DeLarren Young, Orlando Magic</b> - Without a doubt the league's most colorful GM, DeLarren Young comes into an Orlando organization in disarray, looking to straighten things out and pull his team together. With a rag-tag group of cast-offs and misfits, Young brings his winning attitude to the Magic Kingdom. After shipping it's starting lineup to the four winds, Darrell Armstong is now the Magic's most talented player. Matt Harpring and Michael Doleac, who had good showings in their rookie season, will be promoted to the starting lineup along with Bo Outlaw and Tariq Abdul-Wahad. Armen Gilliam, Chris Gatling, Ben Davis, and rookie Corey Maggette will see extensive minutes off the bench. Despite Young's talent, this team needs help. But with little trade-bait, the Magic might be forced to make due with what they have. If anyone can get this team into the playoffs, it's Young - but it's going to be a long, hard battle.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Isaac Sitt, Chicago Bulls</b> - After seeing no less than four GMs on a talented squad last season, the Bulls are relieved to get some stability with the arrival of Isaac Sitt. Sitt led the Jazz to the best record in the West last season, but fell just short of a trip to the finals. Sitt wasted no time in building up his team, sending three players to the Sonics in exchange for Vin Baker. Baker and top rookie Elton Brand will pound the ball inside while Toni Kukoc shoots from deep. Sitt has the desire and the attitide to turn this team around, but without talent, it's going to be a long season in the Windy City.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Dave Hammonds, Seattle Supersonics</b> - "Trader Dave" wasted no time shipping what few star players he had in Seattle for role-players. Hammonds sent Gary Payton and Vin Baker packing and acquired six players in return: Arvydas Sabonis, Will Purdue, rookie Ron Artest, Walt Williams, and former Sonics Hersey Hawkins and Greg Anthony. With this infusion of new talent, Hammonds is hoping to duplicate the success he earned in Indiana last season, where he guided the Pacers to the third best record in the league. Without a go-to guy like Payton or Reggie Miller, several people will have to step up if this team is going to go far. Still, the Sonics are capable of making the playoffs.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Timucin Uras, Detroit Pistons</b> - Last season's most improved GM finished the season with the second best record in the league with the Cleveland Cavaliers under his control. With Matt Pepoff pre-destined to control the Warriors, Timucin Uras was left with the Detroit Pistons. After a quick playoff exit last season, the Pistons hope that Uras can take them to the promised land. Uras' first order of business was dealing All-Star forward Grant Hill to the Heat along with Jud Buechler for Jamal Mashburn, Clarence Weatherspoon, and Dan Majerle. While the trade gives the Pistons the depth needed to make a run at a title, without Hill they are left without a player who can bail them out of trouble when needed. If Uras can get his team to gel, the Pistons could find themselves deep in the playoffs.</p>

<li><p class=text2><b>Matt Pepoff, Golden State Warriors</b> - After an up-and-down season last year, the Warriors needed to bring a winning attidude to their squad. Who better to run the show than the GM of last year's CCBL champion Charlotte Hornets, Matt Pepoff. Although Pepoff lacks the talent that his former team had, he quickly brought in the personnel to suit his style of play. John Starks and Mookie Blaylock were sent packing to make way for a trio of sharpshooters: Cuttino Mobley, Eldridge Recasner, and Chuck Person. Along with Antawn Jamison and Donyell Marshall up front, Pepoff has the players to run the inside-outside game that won him a CCBL-record 73 games last year. Pepoff will have the Warriors playing his trademark  defense to compensate for their lack of top-notch scorers. The Warriors will catch a few teams off guard, but making the playoffs will be an uphill battle to say the least.</p>
