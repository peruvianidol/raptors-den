TORONTO, ONTARIO - After a dramatic win in New Jersey last night, the Raptors were hoping to add to their win total with their preseason rivals, the Miami Heat, in town. The Raptors played tough through the first three quarters, tying the Heat at 30-30. But the Heat, led by Alonzo Mourning's 21 points, clamped down on the Raptors and pulled away for a 43-34 victory.</p>

<p class=text>
The Raptors came out strong once again in the first quarter, as Vince Carter set the tone by hitting his first three shots for the second straight game. The Heat began to pull away in the second quarter, and led 23-17 at the half. But the Raptors fought back hard in the third quarter as Doug Christie evened the game at 26-26 with a three-pointer. On their next possession, Vince Carter broke away for an incredible 360 degree jam which brought the sellout crowd to it's feet to gave the Raptors a 28-26 lead.</p>

<p class=text>With the game tied at 30-30 going into the fourth quarter, Miami held the Raptors to 1-for-11 shooting, with the one shot coming from Dee Brown with just seconds remaining and the game already decided. Brown, who shot 3-for-13 from the field after going 0-for-3 last night, stormed into the locker room after the game and was extremely upset.</p>

<p class=text>"We had that game," Brown told reporters. "I was getting open looks, but the shots just weren't going in. I didn't even realize how many shots I had taken until after the game. I should have tried to get the ball to Vince more instead of looking for my own shot."</p>

<p class=text>Carter finished with 15 points for the second straight game, connecting on seven of his 10 attempts from the field. "Dee is being too hard on himself," said Carter. "Miami shut us down in the fourth. We had our chances, but we lost this game as a team. Dee did not lose the game for us."</p>

<p class=text>Coach Mike Aparicio was not disappointed with his team's effort. "The guys came out tonight and played hard," he said. "We must have played the Heat 10 or 12 times in the offseason, and this was our best game against them yet. It's only the beginning of the season. I felt we played even better tonight than we did last night, which is encouraging. We have three more games against Miami, so we'll have a chance to redeem ourselves. I'm sure all of the guys have the next [Miami game] circled on their calendars."</p>

<p class=text>Alonzo Mourning went 9-for-14 from the field and added seven rebounds to earn player of the game honors. While Dee Brown didn't shoot well, he held Tim Hardaway to 1-of-8 shooting. Hardaway also missed five of his six attempts from the free throw line. Jamal Mashburn added 11 points for the Heat.</p>

<p class=text>Kevin Willis had another solid game for the Raptors with five points and 11 rebounds while starting at center. Charles Oakley, Michael Stewart, and Alvin Williams saw time off the bench along with Tracy McGrady, but none of them could manage to score. Dee Brown finished with seven points and Doug Christie had five.</p>

<p class=text>The Raptors finish off the week by playing host to the Boston Celtics tommorow night.</p>
