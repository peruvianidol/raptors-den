<p class=text>
TORONTO, ONTARIO - After a dismal season which saw the Raptors finish with the worst record in the CCBL, Raptors ownership sought a dedicated GM who could help this talented team reach it's potential. Despite a turbulent season as head coach and GM of the Washington Wizards, Mike Aparicio was hired to turn a struggling Toronto team around. Aparicio has already made an impact on the Raptors, leading them to a 2-2 record, and re-aquiring former Raptor Damon Stoudamire. The Raptors Den recently sat down with Aparicio for an exclusive one-on-one interview.

<p class=text2>
<b>Raptors Den: Let's get straight to the point. Everyone wants to know: can this team make playoffs?</b><br>
Mike Aparicio: Absoulutely. I wouldn't have taken this job if I didn't think that this team could win. It's still early in the season, but so far we have made great strides compared to what this team was doing last year. Once Damon Stoudamire and Cedric Caballos get here, we'll have a solid starting five, with an experienced second-unit backing them up. It'll take a little time for us to all be on the same page, but when this team is clicking on all cylinders, they can beat any team on any given night.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: Was it difficult to let Tracy McGrady go?</b><br>
MA: Very difficult. Tracy is a tremendous athlete and a great person as well. He brought great energy to the team, and even though he's only 20 years old, he can do a number of things on the court very well. But we've been looking at a lot of different offers, trying to improve this team, and this was a deal that we just couldn't pass up. It was a situation where we were very strong at one position, small forward, and very weak at another, point guard. We needed some balance, and by bringing in Damon and Cedric, I think we achieved that.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: What do you like about Damon Stoudamire?</b><br>
MA: Damon is one of the top point guards in the league, and I think he has improved tremendously since he played here last. Damon is very quick, he has tremendous court vision, and he is always working to improve his game. He didn't put up the numbers in Portland that he did here, but back then he was one of the only scoring options this team had, whereas in Portland, he was probably only the third or fourth best player on the team. So naturally he didn't produce as much. Damon got some valuable experience, including playoff experience, which is something that's very important for a point guard to have. You can't be successful with an inexperienced point guard leading your team.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: Can we expect any more trades this season?</b><br>
MA: [laughs] Well, there's always a chance. But I like what we have here, and I don't think we can get much better top to bottom without sacrificing another great player.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: Who has surprised you the most so far?</b><br>
MA: I would have to say Kevin Willis. Kevin is the consumate professional. I was playing him off the bench in the preseason, trying out different lineups, and Kevin didn't complain at all. He came in every game and just did his thing. Kevin does a lot of the little things that don't show up in the box score. He's also a great defensive player, a great low-post scorer, and as he has shown so far this season, our best rebounder. As we got closer to the start of the season, I realized we needed to have Kevin in the starting lineup. And because of his natural leadership abilities, I made him a co-captain along with Vince Carter.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: Speaking of Vince Carter, is he the next Michael Jordan?</b><br>
MA: Vince is certainly an outstanding player, but I think it's unfair to compare him to Jordan. I've been following Vince's career since his days at North Carolina, and after his breakout rookie season, I really wanted to coach him. When the chance came, there was no way I could take another job. In Washington, we had three great players with Juwan Howard, Mitch Richmond, and Rod Strickland, but there was no clear-cut leader. Vince Carter, without question, is the leader of this team.  Our success will depend a lot on Vince, but he can't do it alone.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: What did you learn from your time in Washington?</b><br>
MA: It was tough. I learned never to underestimate an opponent. Before I played in the CCBL, I thought I was a pretty good coach. But I learned that any team can beat anyone at anytime - and we got beat A LOT! [laughs] I stress that a lot to these guys. Another thing I learned was patience. In Washington, I didn't really give some of the guys a chance. If they played poorly, I would take a different direction instead of giving them a second chance. I'm trying to give the guys here a little more slack. I also learned patience in trading. You get a lot of offers in this league, especially when you have talented players like Vince. The trick is to look at the whole picture instead of just looking at the players involved in the deal. And just because a player has established a name for himself in one city doesn't necessarily mean he'll fit into your system.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: You left the Wizards to start your own league. Is there any chance we'll see the SFL again?</b><br>
MA: Right now I'm concentrating on my job here in Toronto. If when the season is over there is an interest in the Summer Fantasy League, I might give it another shot. The project was a little too ambitious, and I learned quickly that I couldn't do it by myself. Unfortunately the collapse of the league left a sour taste in some people's mouths, including my own. If we can get the support and be consistent, it might work. My hat goes off to Al Arango, the commissioner of the CCBL, for the tremendous job he does. I had no idea about all the work that goes into running a league.</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: What do you think about the CCBL this season?</b><br>
MA: The league is loaded with talented and dedicated GMs this season. I don't think the turnover will be nearly as high as it was last season. I also think the league will be a lot more competitive and we won't see it being dominated by just a few teams. The new rule changes should also make things more interesting. I won't make any predictions though, I'll leave that to you guys. [laughs]</p>

<p class=text2>
<b>RD: Any final thoughts?</b><br>
MA: The fan support here in Toronto has been great. The team is very excited, and they're very anxious to win some games for our fans. The fans stuck with us since the beginning, and we're trying hard to reward them with a successful campaign this season. Thank you Toronto for all of your support.</p>
